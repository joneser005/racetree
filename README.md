# racetree
Arduino software + related backing racetree and remote control unit.

/remotecontrol files are for the remote control unit that talks to the race tree via a 2.4Ghz radio.

/tree files are forthe control unit that drives the pinewood race tree / space derby signal board.

I have two race trees, one for space derby events and another for pinewood derby events.  The same remote control unit and tree controller are used with both.  The pinewood version looks like a traditional race tree, made from old erector set parts and cinnamon roll icing cups.  That is the race tree I included in my [Race Tree Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Radio-Controlled-Race-Tree/ "Race Tree Instructable")  I also have a space-themed control board for use in our space derbies.  Both trees are identical in wiring, only differ in appearance.  Simply plug either device into the controller.

The remote unit has a three-position switch to change from three banks of space derby sounds to three banks of pinewood derby sounds.  The scouts love to switch between both sets regardless of event type (space or pinewood).  The third position is for a not-yet-implemented self destruct feature :-)
